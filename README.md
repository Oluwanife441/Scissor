## Cons

1. Can't open application in two tabs (max of 1).
2. Creating URL(custom/shortened) can take up to 2 - 3 minutes.
3. Whenever the shortened link is copied and sent to a new user, the new user must create an account (that means both parties will have to create accounts with scissor).

## How to tackle cons ( Creating URL(custom/shortened) can take up to 2 - 3 minutes )

1. Use a web fast browser (recommended: Google Chrome).
2. Have a stable and fast internet connection everytime the web app is in use to enjoy the most of it.
3. Disable all extensions that might slow down loading process of the web application.
4. If you can't turn off or disable extensions you can always open an incognito tab to test or run this application.
   - Click on the three dots by the far right of your browser (Google chrome).
   - Select "open new incognito tab".
   - Open this and run the application (https://scissor-orpin.vercel.app).
If issue persists, reload your browser and try again (and wait).
